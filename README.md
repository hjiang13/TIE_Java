# TIE_Java
An ImageJ plugin/macro to perform the "Transport of Intensity" TIE equation in Java

TIE is a very simple method to obtain the amount of dry matter in a cell from two or more defocused brightfield images. Once you know the amount of dry matter (which is about the same thing as protein) and cell volume, you know protein concentration. And protein concentration is a characteristic that has long been suspected to control lots of things but it was too difficult to measure it in living cells, especially as they are going through changes like growth, death, signaling, exposure to various solutions, etc. There is a lot of interest now in quantitative cell imaging, and people (like our LCI) are buying expensive machines to do what can be done on any microscope with controlled stage. TIE gives clean high-quality images (as the attached one) â€“ much better than their expensive machines, but requires a mathematical software.
